## Briefly about the project
Hi. Welcome to my GitHub. Here you can see a short demo version of the project, because it is only for portfolio. I don't plan to post the full version of the project here, because it's a personal project.

Briefly about the technologies I have implemented in the project:
- Backend is written in NestJS and I use it with docker.
- Typescript;
- I manipulate data using Rest API.
- Frontend part (NextJS + React + Redux Toolkit) is located here https://github.com/uuu8001uuu/Find-club--React-Nextjs-Typescript-ReduxToolkit
